We provide a Gantt Chart (Fig.\ref{fig:timeline}) for our project timeline. Now we are progressing as planned. Our next step is to test and refine our software, and deploy our software online in the mean time. We have done validation process for image preprocessing and reached a satisfactory result. Test for labeling efficiency will start in the following week.
