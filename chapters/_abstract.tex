Deep learning tasks need a lot of labeled data for training. Building a large dataset of annotated images with many objects is a costly enterprise. Creating semi-automatic algorithms and tools for labeling at an object level is thus an attractive research area. We propose a semi-automated image annotation system, which leverage both the accuracy of manual labeling and the efficiency of automatic labeling. Our system applies existing DNN models to provide a rough annotation output, which human workers can further make corrections on to get an accurate final result. It aims to accelerate the labeling process of images related to autonomous driving scene to produce annotated datasets more efficiently. We will also deploy an online version of our tool focusing on the protection of raw data-set.
