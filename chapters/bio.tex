I am Yueying Li, a senior student of UM-SJTU Joint Institute major in
Electronic and Computer Engineering. I am from the dual degree program with
University of Michigan and have obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
Engineering, while minoring in Math there. My major interests are in signal
processing and systems, especially in algorithm, circuit and architecture
co-design of wireless communication, digital signal processing and machine
learning processors. I am fascinated by their theoretical and application
aspects, including security and reliability in distributed algorithms. Starting
from 2019 Fall, I will be working for Apple in Cupertino.
Interesting facts about me: I like to play the violin and enjoy sports. I've
been playing the violin for 16+ years and have performed in Hill Auditorium at
the University of Michigan. I also won the first place in 2016 departmental
(UM-SJTU) Ping Pong game.
