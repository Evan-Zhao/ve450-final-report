By Design Review \#3, we have clearly understood the customer requirements and
translate them into our QFD. We designed a software solution mainly consists of
image preprocessing and GUI design. We have come up with several concepts for
each part, and finally chose deep learning for image preprocessing and the Qt
framework for GUI design. We have implemented our software and designed a
thorough validation plan. We will continue on testing and refining our software
and finish all the tasks as planned.
